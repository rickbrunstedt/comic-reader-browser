# Comic reader for the browser.

Things used for this: Preact, webassembly, indexdDB API.

Comic reader that I did, to learn more about what you could do with a browser. In short, it unpacks cbr/cbz files with webassembly that you then can read in the browser. It supports offline-mode and installable as pwa for browser that supports that. It even saves the comics to your device using the IndexedDB API. 

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
